# Workout Tracker

## Description 
*Workout Tracker* is a responsive full stack application to help people keep track of their workouts. On the homepage, users can choose to either add exercises to their last workout (if it exists) or to create a new workout to add exercises to. Additionally, users can view the stats for their last seven workouts on the dashboard page, and can also view all of their previous workouts on the history page.
